# TMC6100


## How to use

To access the TMC6100's registers, the TMC-API offers two functions: **tmc6100_readRegister** and **tmc6100_writeRegister**.
Each of these functions takes in an **icID**, which is used to identify the IC when multiple ICs are connected. This identifier is passed down to the callback functions (see How to Integrate).

## How to integrate: overview

1. Include all the files of the TMC-API/ic/tmc/TMC6100 folder into the custom project.
2. Include the TMC6100.h file in the custom source code.
3. Implement the necessary callback functions (see below).
4. (optional): Take a look at the Examples subfolder for ready-made examples of the TMC-API usage.

## Accessing the TMC6100 via SPI
The following diagram depicts how to access the TMC6100 via SPI using the TMC-API.

The description of the functions, in the above flowchart, are as follows:
- The functions tmc6100_readRegister and tmc6100_writeRegister are used to read and write the registers respectively. These functions check the current active bus and calls the bus-specific function i.e readRegisterSPI or writeRegisterSPI.
- These bus specific functions constructs the datagram and further calls the bus specific callback 'tmcXXXX_readWriteSPI.
- This callback function further calls the hardware specific read/write function for SPI and needs to be implemented externally.

### How to integrate: Callback functions
To communicate with TMC6100 IC, the TMC-API library needs to know which bus (UART, SPI) it shall use. For that, the callback function **'tmc6100_getBusType()'** needs to be implemented.
Additionally, implement the following callback functions to access the chip via SPI:
1. **tmc6100_readWriteSPI()**, which is a HAL wrapper function that provides the necessary hardware access. This function should also set the chip select pin CSN to low before starting the data transfer and set to high upon completion. Please refer to the datasheet of the IC for further details.

## Migration status
The TMC6100 has been reworked to the access system described above. For more infos on the status of this and other ICs, check out the [migration page](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TMC-API/issues/53).
